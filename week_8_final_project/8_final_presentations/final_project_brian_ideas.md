Brian's ideas for Final Project (YMMV)
-----

- Image Classifier:
    + Labradoodle or fried chicken
    + Chihuahua or muffin
    + sleeping dog or bagel
- An image recognition app that plays songs based on recognizing someone's face
    - See a Beth play "Beth" by KISS 
    - See a Alison by "Alison" by Elvis Costello
- A self driving car that follows people in a creepy way
- Image Style Transfer
    + Your face with a celebrity for kid planning
    + Your face with emoji ðŸ˜œ
